## SAT Solver (Recursion)
The following outlines how the recursive algorithm was implemented.
1. Parse cnf file and dump contents into an Immutable List of clauses (`ImList`)
2. If there are no clauses, the formula is trivially satisfiable. Exit the function by returning the environment.
3. Otherwise, find the smallest clause from the list of clauses
    1. If the clause is empty, the list of clauses is unsatisfiable. Bind an empty clause to FALSE and backtrack by returning the environment.
    2. If the clause has a single literal, bind the literal to the environment such that the clause is satisfiable
    3. Otherwise, pick an arbitrary literal from this small clause
        1. Set the literal to TRUE
        2. Substitute this literal to TRUE in all other clauses (using the `substitute()` method)
        3. Solve recursively. 
        4. If it fails, try setting the literal to FALSE. Then, repeat steps 1 to 3.

## 2-SAT Solver (DFS via Kosaraju's algorithm)
The following outlines how the DFS algorithm was implemented.
1. Parse cnf file and dump contents into a dictionary such that an implication graph is created
2. Using DFS on this graph, store the vertices into a sorted stack whereby the topmost element contains the vertex with the highest finishing time
3. Get the transposed of the graph
4. Pick the topmost element of the stack until the stack is empty
    1. Store the element into a reversed stack
    2. Conduct DFS on the transposed graph using the element identify all strongly connected components (SCCs) of the implication graph
    3. For each element visited during the DFS, store the element into the same SCC
    4. Store each SCC into an array (in other words, SCCs are stored in a two-dimensional (2D) array)
5. Iterate through the 2D array of SCCs
    1. Check that the SCC does not contain both a literal and its negated form. If it does, the solution is unsatisfiable. Return early.
    2. Otherwise, create a condensed graph by storing the first element within each SCC as the key and the rest of the elements as the value
6. Pick the topmost element of the reversed stack until the stack is empty
    1. Ceate a dictionary (called `result`) that stores the element as the key, and its negated boolean expression (e.g. If the element is '1', then assign it to `false`. If the element is '-1', assign it to `true`) as the value.
    2. Do the same for nodes adjacent to the element.
    3. Note: Only store the element and the nodes adjacent to it within the dictionary if it cannot be found within the dictionary
7. Return `result`

## Randomized 2-SAT Solver (Random walk type algorithm)
The following outlines how the randomized solver was implemented.
1. Parse cnf file and dump contents into three arrays as follows
    1. `litArray` represents the current truth assignment of literals in order, initialized to contain all `false`
    2. `negateArray` contains  `true` at the literal of a specific clause if the literal is inverted in the formula, else `false` by default
    3. `clauseArray` contains the literal number (ie. `x_1 âˆ§ x_2` of clause 1 returns `1` at `clauseArray[0][0]` and `2` at `clauseArray[0][1]`
2. Call `mainSolver` to solve the formula until either the formula is satisfiable with a specific truth assginment or the number of iterations reached `NUM_ITER` (declared in main)
    1. Solve formula with current truth assignment using `formulaSolver`
    2. If formula is not satisfied, `coinflip` to determine a literal in the first unsatisfiable clause to flip and proceed to next iteration
    3. If formula is satisfied, return
3. Return `litArray`
